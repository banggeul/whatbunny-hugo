Warp and Weft is an ongoing project involving a series of hand-woven tapestries constructed from paper printouts of legal documents (from state codes concerning abortion, and anti-immigration memoranda to Supreme Court opinions from the last decade, which have steadily gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965.) Accompanying the tapestry is a photographic series in which I sleep, meditate, read and poop while wearing the fabric in various ways.
