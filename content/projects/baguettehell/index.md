Playing on the word “bagatelle” (meaning a trifling or inconsequential thing), Baguette Hell features a series of interactive iPad and iPhone apps toying with images of its namesake French bread. Reminiscent of Dadaist exercises, the apps are seemingly impractical or pointless, but are also playful, flirtatious and delightfully strange.
